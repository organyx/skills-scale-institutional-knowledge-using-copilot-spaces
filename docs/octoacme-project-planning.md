# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and cross-functional delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Conduct initial UX research and design review (if applicable)
4. Perform threat modeling and security assessment (if applicable)
5. Define data tracking and success metrics with Data Analyst
6. Review infrastructure and deployment requirements with DevOps
7. Assess support documentation and training needs
8. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
9. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including security, UX, and support criteria
10. Identify dependencies and integration points
11. Create release plan and milestone map

## Backlog Item Template
- **Title**:
- **Description**:
- **Acceptance criteria**:
- **Priority**:
- **Estimate**:
- **Owner**:
- **Related docs/links**:
- **UX requirements**: (design needed, user research, accessibility)
- **Security requirements**: (security review, threat model, compliance)
- **Data/metrics**: (tracking events, success metrics, A/B test plan)
- **DevOps/infrastructure**: (deployment needs, config changes, monitoring)
- **Support documentation**: (help docs, FAQs, training materials)

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
