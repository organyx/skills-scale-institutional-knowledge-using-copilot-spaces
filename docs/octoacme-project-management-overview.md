# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- **Customer-first**: prioritize customer value and usability.
- **Iterative delivery**: deliver small, testable increments.
- **Clear ownership**: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- **Data-informed decisions**: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- **Psychological safety**: encourage feedback and learning.
- **Cross-functional collaboration**: engage UX, security, DevOps, support, and data expertise from the start.
- **Security by design**: integrate security reviews and best practices throughout the lifecycle.
- **User-centered design**: validate with user research and feedback continuously.

## Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM)**: coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Developers**: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **QA/Testing**: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- **UX Designer**: creates intuitive user experiences through research, design, and testing.
- **DevOps Engineer**: builds CI/CD pipelines, manages infrastructure, ensures reliability.
- **Data Analyst**: tracks metrics, conducts experiments, provides data-driven insights.
- **Customer Support Lead**: manages support team, escalates issues, represents customer voice.
- **Security Champion**: embeds security practices, conducts reviews, manages vulnerabilities.
- **Stakeholders**: provide inputs and approvals.

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
