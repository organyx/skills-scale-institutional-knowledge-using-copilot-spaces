# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items
- Metrics review: success metrics, user feedback, support trends
- Security and quality observations
- Cross-functional collaboration insights

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Include cross-functional team members (developers, QA, UX, DevOps, security, support as relevant)
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Review key metrics: velocity, quality, user satisfaction, support tickets
- Discuss UX feedback and user research insights
- Review security issues and technical debt
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
